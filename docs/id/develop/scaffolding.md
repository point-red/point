# Scaffolding

Scaffolding roughly aims to a quickly set up skeleton for an app or your project. The main purpose of Scaffolding is to speed your workflow rather than creating it new.

## Master Scaffolding

With master scaffolding you can create a new master in no time. 
Just run this command and you will have all the template for your work.

```
php artisan scaffolding:generate Master Warehouse
```

Then register your routes in `routes/api/master.php`

```
...

Route::apiResource('warehouses', 'WarehouseController');
```

So, as you can see below the result of our scaffolding

Now you are ready to go to implement your code without doubt with structure.
