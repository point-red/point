## Semantic Versioning

Point release using semantic versioning 2.0.0. Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
2. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
3. PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.

## Point 0.x.x

- Current version is for initial development. Anything may change at any time. The public API should not be considered stable.


- Version 1.0.0 defines the public API. The way in which the version number is incremented after this release is dependent on this public API and how it changes.
